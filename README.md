# Catnap ✧/ᐠ-ꞈ-ᐟ\ —ฅ/ᐠ. ̫ .ᐟ\ฅ —

--------

I've tried to implement my own cute little functional programming language for a long while now,
and I keep hitting a wall. I like to call this collection of project [*Carnap*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap) after my favorite philosopher and logician. Cats are really cute too, and I enjoy naps whenever I get the chance.

I'm absolutely fascinated by interactive proof assistants and theorem provers,
so I thought that it'd be cool to attempt at writing my own:

I'll enumerate some of the goals I have in mind for the project.

## Goals

- [x] Have fun /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ✿\
- [ ] Learn about the Calculus of Inductive Constructions
- [ ] Create an interpreted intermediate representation based off of [Henk](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1997/01/henk.pdf)
  + [ ] Get an up and running lexer
  + [ ] Work on interpretation strategies (bytecode etc)
  + [ ] Flesh out the standard library a bit
- [ ] Implement core, verified kernel from which to expand to a full proof writing language

## Far-off Goals, like from here to the moon and back x100
- [ ] Optimize core language and compilation, and explore compilation to machine code
- [ ] See about writing own proof writing application
- [ ] Machine learning for proof writing based off of stored proof metadata (Coq stores proofs, so 
look into that  /ᐠ≗ᆽ≗ᐟ \)
